# PATENTS

As of this publication, no patents have been filed for any part of the RUNE project.

---

The RUNE framework, including its runtime architecture, orchestration design, plugin mediation patterns, and error-handling protocols, is publicly documented and published under an open license (MPL-2.0) as prior art.

This constitutes a defensive disclosure to prevent others from patenting the core framework, its communication protocols, or plugin interface contracts.

The project author retains all rights to pursue future defensive filings or claim original authorship if patent applications infringe upon this prior art.

If this project incorporates third-party packages that are themselves subject to patent grants, those are governed by their respective licenses (see `pyproject.toml`).

This document does **not** grant any patent licenses beyond those already implied or covered under MPL-2.0.

For any questions regarding licensing or intellectual property, contact the project maintainer directly.
